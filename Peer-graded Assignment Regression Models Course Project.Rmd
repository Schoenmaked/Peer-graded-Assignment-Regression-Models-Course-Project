# Summary 
#The Motor Trend is a magazine about the automobile industry.
#Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested 
#in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per 
#gallon (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:
# Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG"?
# Answer: It seems that the MPG transmission is better by 30%. The difference is around 7.24
# Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions?
# Answer: A Manual transmission improves the MPG by 1.81.Pr(>|t|) 2.064597e-01
# to answer these questions a The T-Test and a Regression Analysis was performed.
